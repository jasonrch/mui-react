# Overview

I made this to work with material-ui a little bit. I like a lot of the styles and thought it would be a fun little side project to work on.

### `Uses`

You can filter users based off the search bar in the upper right, Add a new user from the form at the bottom of the page, and delete users with the delete button on the upper right of each card. I mainly just used this to test out material ui.
